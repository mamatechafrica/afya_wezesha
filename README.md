# Sauti Safe App  

**Empowering Survivors, Amplifying Voices.**  

The **Sauti Safe App** is a secure and user-friendly Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to empower survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) by providing a confidential way to report incidents and access resources. Our mission is to create a world where survivors feel heard and supported, and communities are equipped to respond effectively to GBV.
